There is a real security hole in this (otherwise great) recipe. This line in the .htaccess file:

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

tells Apache, "If the URL maps to a real file, **serve it to anyone who asks for it**, otherwise, apply the RewriteRule (which activates the Flask app). In other words, make every file in this subdirectory tree publicly readable. And, if a URL that Flask is trying to serve happens to coincide with an actual file, the direct contents of the file take precedence. If you want the Flask app to control access, or if there is any information in the directory you want to keep secret, then you need a much more restrictive rule, Fortunately it's not that hard; replace the RewriteCond line with (following Will's example):

RewriteCond %(REQUEST_FILENAME) !=/full/home/path/public_html/flask_hello_world/flask_hello_world.fcgi

That should be all one line. $HOME doesn't work in this context, you have to spell it out. What this RewriteCond means is, treat this *one file* in the usual way, which has been set up to be a CGI script. Every other URL in this subdirectory goes through Flask. You could set up more exceptions using multiple RewriteCond lines, but allowing nothing and adding individual exceptions is the right way to start.

By the way, the overall recipe works on DreamHost, too.
